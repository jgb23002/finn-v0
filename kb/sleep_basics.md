# Sleep Basics

Consistent sleep schedules support circadian rhythms. Aim for a regular bedtime and wake time, dark and cool rooms, and limited screens 1 hour before bed. Caffeine late in the day and irregular naps can disrupt sleep. A wind-down routine (dim lights, light stretch, reading) helps signal your body to rest.
